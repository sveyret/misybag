# MisybaG, mini-system based on Gentoo

MisybaG is a tool which can be used to create very light system remote controlled by a Gentoo system. The mini-sytem can be updated using portage. Note that the created mini-system *is not Gentoo*.

# Language/langue

Because French is my native language, finding all documents and messages in French is not an option. Other translations are welcome.

Anyway, because English is the language of programming, the code, including variable names and comments, are in English.

:fr: Une version française de ce document se trouve [ici](doc/fr/README.md).
